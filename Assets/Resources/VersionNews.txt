v2018.10.a.1

- Followers are now romanceable (not all followers in all circumstances)
- Extremely minimal Rivals implementation
- various smol fixes and content tweaks


v2018.9.g.1
- fixed a bug where a save created on the main branch couldn't be saved after loading it on the beta branch


v2018.9.f.1
- Output cards stack more helpfully
- Weary Detective is always the first Hunter spawn
- If you send a mortal follower to destroy evidence, and they fail, they will be wounded rather than disappearing. Summoned minions will still just disappear.
- Fixed bug where Edge, Forge and Heart cults couldn't be founded
- three new books!

v2018.9.e.1
- Followers may receive Gifts
- Aspirant is now the default legacy again
- Restlessness now also has Heart value. What does not cease, is not ceased.
- Aspirant is now a little more generous with your starting payment
- Aspirant Study verb now unlocks correctly, again
- Two distinct restart bugs fixed. Restart should now behave better.
- lots of WIP for romance and Dancer that shouldn't be visible, but may cause accidental bugs or save issues: let me know if so

v2018.9.d.3
- A very limited preview version of the Dancer legacy (one victory, no ascensions, some other features missing) is available to everyone. Honestly I just wanted to get this patch live and didn't want to fiddle around with DLC. It'll be limited to Perpetual Edition owners / new DLC purchasers next time.
- The Season of Sickness will now also accept Fatigued Health, making Sickness a bit less menacing
- Fatigue now has Heart value, and Restlessness now also has Moth value (I don't really know why it ever didn't)
- Glimmering, Vitality and Erudition spawn more frequently.
- Cult Business and Expedition challenges can no longer have a 100% chance of success - max is 90%. Don't panic! See Wounds notes from 2018.7.d.1

v2018.9.c.2
- A Sanskrit tutor is available.
- Vitality, Erudition and Glimmering are now Influences, and may be sometimes be gained through Augury.
- Health skill can't be used to produce Health infinitely - it tops out
- Health skill can now be specialised as Strength or Grace
- Vitality, Erudition and Glimmering now have Heart, Lantern and Moth aspects.
- It's now possible to attack Hunters directly.
- If you attack a Hunter directly and fail, they won't give you a second chance.

v2018.7.g.2
- fixed a nasty double-click issue where cards could disappear en route to a slot if the slot disappeared

v2018.7.g.1
- abating visions now gives Lantern Influence, not Fleeting Memory

v2018.7.f.1
- fixes for issues with saving and loading. Hit us up at support@weatherfactory.biz if you come across any more save/load issues!
- fixes for double-click assign issues.
- double-click animation is now much faster.
- fixed an issue where the game would forget where a stack started
- double-clicking now opens-closes info panel, so you don't have to wait another half-second on single-click
- Augury cult business displays text on failure again
- vsync enabled on Basic graphics level again - this may help address issues with Mac notebooks inexplicably overheating
- [earlier hotfix] Founding Cults with Health is no longer an endless pit of consuming pain with a game-breaking bug

v2018.7.e.1
- Fleeting Memory cures Fascination! \o/
- Early Night will occasionally create Fascination or Dread :(
- Health, Reason and Passion still count as Ingredients, but using them with Rites or when recruiting/upgrading will convert them to their fatigued versions, instead of using them up.
- Injury still counts as an ingredient. Using it with a Rite or recruitment converts it to a Knock-Scar. (which still has placeholder art, don't panic)

v2018.7.d.1
- Followers who become casualties in Expeditions or Cult Business are now Wounded instead of dying outright
- Wounded Followers can still die if you don't heal them sharpish
- Healed Followers gain Scars which can increase some Aspects
- Three Scars of the same type will kill a Follower anyway
- on the upside, their corpse retains the extra aspects
- ALL THIS IS SUBJECT TO BALANCE AND REVISION AND WHATNOT

v2018.7.b.3
- Fixed a raft of horrible OSX issues

v2018.7.b.2
- bug fixes for double-click and save file issues
- preparatory loc work - don't panic if fonts look a bit different


v2018.7.b.1

- shift-click-and-drag now drags a whole stack.
- double-click sends card to nearest open slot. *This is quite experimental and may cause issues we've missed - please let us know any at support@weatherfactory.biz


v2018.7.n.2

- imprisoning a follower now correctly causes notoriety.

v2018.6.n.1

- Unique items should now be unique even after the deck has refreshed.
- You shouldn't see a Troublemaker and Acquaintance version of a potential cultist appear in the same run.

v2018.6.m.1

- Restarting should now always just start from the beginning of your current Legacy.
- Weary Detective is not unique, again, this week.
- Lots of message oddities tidied up
- Unfairly teasing recruitment text no longer appears for Patrons
- Legacy image for Detective no longer shows sometimes as Lantern. (You may still get a Detective choice twice in rare circs.)


v2018.6.k.2
- 64-bit Linux works again
- Start Recipe no longer auto-starts all recipes ever ("Oh, *that's* what Gravity is for in the InputManager")
- Tidied up hints and promotion recipes to make it clearer which followers can be Exalted.
- Tenacious Detectives *were* surviving too often in some circumstances - there was a mistake in the proc chance. Sorry, folks. Fixed.
- Fixed *lots* of issues with escaped summonings


v2018.6.k.1
- Zoom, Collect All, Start Recipe now configurable
- open save file location now works on major Linux distros
- force invariant culture to fix Linux save file issues (thanks Fraser McCormick for these)
- Collect All no longer breaks if you've just picked up one of the things you're collecting
- Splash screen should display more reliably on odd video setups

v2018.6.h.1
- snap-to-grid for cards is now available; take a look in the Options menu to switch it on.

v2018.6.g.2
- basic data modding is now enabled. See /cultistsimulator_Data/StreamingAssets/content/readme.txt if you're interested.
- more bombproofing on save loading and Mansus exits for fewer crashes.

v2018.6.f.1
- Status bar now shows count of exhausted Abilities
- Detective can now Dream without reading the Sealed File. Thematically I loved that he couldn't Dream until then, but it's too much of a pain for healing from illness.
- Vignette at the top of the screen is a little lighter.
- Autosave triggering when you're dropping a card sometimes borked your save. We *hope* this is now resolved. Let us know.

v2018.6.e.1
- added hints for Fucine
- Restart button now wants you to be really sure

v2018.6.d.1
- Next/Previous text buttons less twitchy
- Spintriae are now (as intended) only Ingredients, not tools. This should be backwards-compatible with save files in all situations, but please let me know if you hit any problems.
- Saving/reloading with a card in a situation doesn't reset that card's decay lifetime, or any acquired aspects like Detective abilities.
- Saving/reloading doesn't make aspects disappear from Situations
- and saving/reloading doesn't let ppl keep marked-for-consumption elements, like funds in bookshops.

v2018.6.c.7

- Sundry crash-proofing effects
- Options Menu should appear reliably
- Options Menu should no longer unpause the game when closed.

v2018.6.b.2

- Moderately ridiculous bug with fatigued ability art fixed.
- Some last touches of the art paintbrush.
- Typo fixes
- ...and an Easter egg of sorts.


v2018.5.w.2 changes. This represents a flurry of unusually keen feedback and bug reports: thank you all.

- Nasty save bug fixed (game was silently failing to save on exit in some circumstances)
- Fatigued Abilities, and the Ecdysis Club, now become less bleached, not more, as they refresh
- Shuffling around of Edge, Heart, and Secret Histories works
- It's no longer possible to incorporate corpses directly into paintings
- Corpses decay to Notoriety. Well they decay to a number of things, but Notoriety is the relevant one.]
- Various typo fixes and clue improvements
- Naming field now accepts a greater variety of characters

v2018.5.u.2 changes:

- Unique lantern painting should now display correct text, remove pigment
- The game should no longer misbehave if autosave occurs while you're dragging something.

v2018.5.t.2 changes:

- dropping a card on a token no longer moves the token. This means fewer cascade cardalanches
- cards are a bit more forgiving about being overlapped.

v2018.5.t.1 changes:

- Doom predictor now predicts doom less haphazardly
- St Nympha, not St Respicus (sic), now has the starring role in 'The Rose of Hypatia'
