v2020.8.a.2; "The Correspondence of Origin"

- updated to latest major version of Unity
- /images/ui added to modding framework. You can now use tablecoverimage:, tablesurfaceimage:, and tableedgeimage: on Legacies to customise table appearance.
- Fixed Chinese loc
- Fixed Chinese and Russian slot labels, which were showing in English
- loc files renamed to loc_[culture]
- loc files are now loaded *after* mods - so if you've extended an entity in your mod, any relevant loc will still apply to it
- you can now add loc files to a mod (or create a mod consisting only of loc files) - just add loc json files to loc/loc_[culture]

v2020.8.a.1; "The Solution of Memory"

- substantial code rewrite; there may be odd bugs.
- mod framework rework and upgrade

v2020.6.b.1; "Urizen's Book of Gold, or, Why I Don't Usually Put Patches Out On Friday PM"
MAIN GAME
- Fixed missing art for Overexposure

EXILE
- 'A crucial missing link made it impossible to get one of the more obscure endings. I've fixed that.'  Now actually fixed.
- Profane Weapon repurchase now cleanly replaces exhausted Profane Weapon
- Addresses (Office, Warehouse, Townhouse, Villa) now have the Deception aspect, though you can't use two addresses topether to erase a Trace.
- Biedde's Blade is now available in appropriate cities.
- The Old Retainer will no longer follow you if exhausted when you change cities
- Clarified that you can't cause a revolution in a city unless it's Troubled
- Removed the word 'small' when referring to Trace risks.


v2020.6.a.1: "The Meridian Unites"
EXILE

BALANCING
- The Sunset, Dawn and Night opportunities all now have relevant Principle aspects.
- The Night opportunity now has the Deception aspect.
- Added an extra Sea draw to Seaports.


BUG FIXES
- A crucial missing link made it impossible to get one of the more obscure endings. I've fixed that.
- Profane Weapon purchase opportunity shouldn't have been unique, and it's not now.
- Missing art references fixed for Lionsmith shrine Venice, Colonel shrine Valletta, Book of Suns page purchase ops from zones 2 and 3, Momentum, and Merry Feaster's Carcass. 
- The Shrine of the Nameless art was meant to be plain black, but it was reading as a mistake to players, so Lottie's drawn something charming.
- I can confirm that where you were referred to as '[your mother's] son' that was a typo, or rather braino. The gender of Exile characters is unspecified as usual, and this isn't a weird subtle lore point.
