- It's now possible to repair a sabotaged Dawnbreaker Core. Sorry about that.
- Summons now markedly less voracious.
- Fixed an infuriatingly subtle bug where Time would start passing very late when you play as a Bright Young Thing.

v2019.2.a.1

- added experimental dropzone to allow you to direct cards somewhere specific
- Stag Door entry proofed against an odd bug
- various summoning fixes
- greedy-grab runs a little faster to help with situations where you're about to die from lack of health and it turns up with v little time to spare
- Collect-All now sends Mansus cards to dropzone, not to initiating location
- cards which were stacked when added to a recipe can now go into a different stack if their origin stack has disappeared.
- Keyboard scroll more responsive
- High contrast mode persisted between loads
- FIXED SHRINKY SALIBA
- game over music respects volume, now

v2019.1.k.1

- fixed a case where the Apostle update broke the Dancer legacy on Steam
- which also fixed the Enigmatic Square White Legacy bug
- game now recognises when you try to betray a mentor, but just can't quit them
- sundry typo fixes and minor bugfixes. Thanks to everyone who reported them!

v2019.1.i.1: Illopoly

- Apostle legacies now in game! After you've completed a minor victory, try to complete your predecessor's ascension. Note: thanks to some very powerful interference these are  much harder.
- escaped summonings now bite
- Grail auction no longer won without funds
- Grail auction never won cheap
- Ready for Apostle lift-off
- Forlorn Blood sickness no longer snags wounded followers
- Can't found two cults
- Watchers added by Long should now work as intended
- High Contrast option in settings
- Summonings now usually leave a residue when destroyed- Special characters should now be possible when naming your character. I mean special characters like " and %, not like Enid. However, you can call your character Enid, if you like.
- You can now close verb windows with a keystroke (Escape by default). I'm sorry we didn't do this before. It's my fault. I don't know what I was thinking.
- Ezeem, Crucible and Teresa are now rather more effectively unique.
- Forlorn Blood may now kill you.


v2018.12.b.1

- Major Expeditions rework to reduce midgame grind, including six new Expeditions. Expeditions now give fixed, more thematically suitable, and usually more impressive, rewards. Default expeditions give you a chance to scoop up books from any Expeditions consumed by Rivals, and also can be repeated to gain Ingredients. (If you're in mid-game when this patch hits, it might mean you get some items twice on your current playthrough: call it a bonus.)
- Fixed a rare issue where it was still sometimes possible to put a stack of >1 card in a slot (if you swapped out one card of that type for a stack of identical cards)
- Fixed an even rarer issue where saving the game with two funds in unstarted Expedition slots would leave you with only 1 Funds on reloading.
- 30% of the time, failing to use a Favour to save a Follower would leave you under suspicion instead. This should no longer happen.
- Removed Bloodshed, for now.
- Reduced Fleeting Reminiscence duration to make it more Fleeting. It'll get more fleeting still, but I didn't want to cause too much unexpected pain when this hit the main branch.
- Rite of the Sea's Marriage is now Rite of the Crow's Quenching.
- You shouldn't see two Detective legacies
- Loads of enhancements to debug console
- Extremely alpha implementation of the first Major Victory. Currently, it's only possible to pursue a Forge apostle legacy (by completing the Forge/Power minor victory) and there is only a very limited implementation
of just one of the immortal enemies you'll face. But it should give you an idea of what's coming. :) [This is unavailable in the main branch.]
- Lessons Learnt now decay to their antecedents. (Thanks for the feedback on this! It should always have been thus, really)
- Added a couple of Dancer hints


v2018.11.c.1:
- Corpses when raised will never fight to break control.
- Corpses when raised with a missing Follower aspect due to wounds will have Follower restored.
- Defeating Fascination with Fleeting Memory never creates a Consciousness of Radiance.
- Moth and Heart endings now correctly signal upcoming endingness.
- Permanent card elimination now occurs when a deck's list of standard cards, not current cards, contains a unique card or uniqueness group member card. Excited yet? Okay, this means that if you draw a book from a deck that reshuffles, it's now permanently eliminated from that deck, so you can't get multiple Viennese Conundra-a from Ecdysis.

v2018.11.b.1:
- Pawns now correctly show up as Troublemakers in Detective legacies.
- Burgeoning and Shattered Risen will endure for twice as long.
- The Bone Flute can now be given to Followers.
- Ctrl + ' also now brings up the console, as an alternative to Ctrl + `. Sorry, Italian keyboard users and others!
- Clarified some hint text.
- Typo fixes


v2018.11.a.1:

- Stability improvements
- infrastructure work to support localisation
- typos

- Detectives can now be captured again.
- Typos
- Fixed a backwards compatibility issue with skill upgrading in the pre-Teresa builds.

v2018.10.k.4: 'Kronos'
- Major change to influences; they can now be harvested and upgraded in a whole bunch of combinations, and they decay slowly. This is an intended change that didn't quite make it into Teresa's Update. [Note: it makes Heart ascension significantly easier.]
- Creeping Breath Curse icon now displays correctly
- Curses can now be defeated, although not easily.
- Tweaks and bumps to Mansus rewards - in particular, there are now a couple of extra ways to get Heart influence.
- Romance: Uses of Strength no longer lets you put any old rubbish in the slot
- Now that Lantern and Winter influence turn into Fascination and Dread, Fascination and Dread no longer give Lantern and Winter influence when defeated.
- Inductions (those transient thirty-second verbs that sawn Restlessness, Vitality, Dread, etc) no longer spawn new inductions in their turn.
- Spawn chance of inductions slightly reduced.
- Attempting a Heart or Moth ascension, and then turning aside to be with your beloved, will now trigger the correct ending.
- A special case of a secret victory will now trigger correctly. You'll know it if you've seen it.
- Fixed a bug where it was possible to skip a step on the route to that secret victory.
- Final Dancer job upgrade now requires Grace specialisation for Health skill.
- Fixed missing text for the final Dancer job upgrade.
- Added an additional Dancer hint.
- Added a side-effect from use of Glassfinger Toxin.


v2018.10.i.1: 'Janus'
- Visions and Despair now give a visible and audible warning when they reach 2 F or D
- Guises in Dancer now give a small advantage on the relevant expedition
- Guises are mutually unique
- Passion and Reason textbooks now work with the Lessons Learnt system

v2018.10.h.1: 'Hope'
- When a detective defeats an independent troublemaker, a new troublemaker will appear. The struggle is real.
- Detectives will have more temptations to resist if they burn the first file.
- When Disciples or Exalted followers rebel, they become more powerful Rivals/Long in the making immediately.
- Dammit Fraser stay in the credits
- Tristan ending image shows up
- Laidlaw romance not intermittently in second person
- Cheevos now trigger correctly for exalts, and also won't try to trigger more than once per card
- Elridge doesn't lose his lust: power when promoted to an Assassin
- Jealousy only triggers when romantic interest exists


v2018.10.g.1: 'Gravitas'
- Fleeting Memories can be used again to address Fascination (not sure when that broke)
- Defeating Fascination gives Lantern influence, defeating Despair gives Winter influence
- round-up of bug fixes and typos/contumps
- The tiniest of surprises

v2018.10.f.1: 'Ferocity'
- filled in some missing art
- fixed soft-greedy-grab bug that sometimes made the player accidentally bin off their ain true love
- some things are unique-r (eg: it should never be possible to have concurrent different versions of the same follower)
- some Dancer fixes and clues
- a small surprise

v2018.10.e.1: 'Elegance'
- bug fixes to Skills/stats
- Corpses and Risen now retain additional aspects from life; so e.g. Winter-scarred corpses are easier to raise and more powerful

- nother book
- a surprise

v2018.10.d.1: 'Detection'
- Nasty ascension bug fixed
- Skills rework: Passion, Reason and Health are now all capped
- ...but much easier to get, with the 'Lesson Learnt' mechanic.
- A small surprise.


v2018.10.b.1: 'Bitterness'
- Much richer Rivals implementation. Rivals will conduct expeditions and attempt to ascend in your place. Set traps for them and whittle down their health. Treat them with caution, and hope they'll come back around to your side. Or feed Notoriety to the Suppression Bureau in the hope they'll pursue your Rivals instead.
- a larger number of highly specialised victories, and a new loss
- fixed bug where cult formation wasn't giving HQs

v2018.10.a.1: 'Ardour'
- Followers are now romanceable (not all followers in all circumstances)
- Extremely minimal Rivals implementation
- various smol fixes and content tweaks
