THE HARBINGER'S BUILD

<i>This contains a multitude of usability tweaks and mechanics, and a tomb-load of new content. This is the last major build before launch: there's some missing content and we want to tweak a few last mechanics. </i>

Thank you, everyone, for the thousands of feedback points and bug reports we've had over the last six months. You've helped make the game what it is. Please keep sending them to support@weatherfactory.biz!

The one overwhelming issue in feedback has been 'I'm a bit confused'. Confusion is part of the point of the game... but we don't want to be needlessly opaque. So we've been focusing on addressing that, and not all the remaining legacies may make it in before launch. Don't worry! We're committing here to adding them all after launch, still.

If you'd like to help further - do tell your friends to wishlist the game on Steam, and make a joyful noise on launch day. We'll be live-streaming on Kickstarter when we press the button, at 6pm GMT on 31st May 2018.
