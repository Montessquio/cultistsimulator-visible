- You can now close verb windows with a keystroke (Escape by default). I'm sorry we didn't do this before. It's my fault. I don't know what I was thinking.
- Ezeem, Crucible and Teresa are now rather more effectively unique.
- Forlorn Blood may now kill you.


v2018.12.b.1

Default expeditions give you a chance to scoop up books from any Expeditions consumed by Rivals, and also can be repeated to gain Ingredients. (If you're in mid-game when this patch hits, it might mean you get some items twice on your current playthrough: call it a bonus.)
- Fixed a rare issue where it was still sometimes possible to put a stack of >1 card in a slot (if you swapped out one card of that type for a stack of identical cards)
- Fixed an even rarer issue where saving the game with two funds in unstarted Expedition slots would leave you with only 1 Funds on reloading.
- 30% of the time, failing to use a Favour to save a Follower would leave you under suspicion instead. This should no longer happen.

- Rite of the Sea's Marriage is now Rite of the Crow's Quenching.
- You shouldn't see two Detective legacies
- Loads of enhancements to debug console
- Extremely alpha implementation of the first Major Victory. Currently, it's only possible to pursue a Forge apostle legacy (by completing the Forge/Power minor victory) and there is only a very limited implementation
of just one of the immortal enemies you'll face. But it should give you an idea of what's coming. :) [This is unavailable in the main branch.]
- Lessons Learnt now decay to their antecedents. (Thanks for the feedback on this! It should always have been thus, really)

v2018.11.c.1:

- Curses can now be defeated, although not easily.
- Tweaks and bumps to Mansus rewards - in particular, there are now a couple of extra ways to get Heart influence.
