THE EXPLORER'S BUILD

<i>This adds the ability to locate and loot locations out in the world, and substantially expands what is available to you through dreams. You can also find lots and lots and *lots* of new books. More art is popping in, and KING CRUCIBLE NOW SPEAKS IN ALL CAPS</i>.

There will be missing bits of content and other oddities, and the game balance is be all *over* the place.

Please send feedback and bug reports to support@weatherfactory.biz.

Thank you for your time, your enthusiasm, and the loan of your soul.
