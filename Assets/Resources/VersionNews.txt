v2018.10.k.1: 'Kronos'
- Major change to influences; they can now be harvested and upgraded in a whole bunch of combinations, and they decay slowly. This is an intended change that didn't quite make it into Teresa's Update. [Note: it makes Heart ascension significantly easier.]
- Affliction Curse icon now displays correctly
- Curses can now be defeated, although not easily.
- Tweaks and bumps to Mansus rewards - in particular, there are now a couple of extra ways to get Heart influence.
- Romance: Uses of Strength no longer lets you put any old rubbish in the slot
- Now that Lantern and Winter influence turn into Fascination and Dread, Fascination and Dread no longer give Lantern and Winter influence when defeated.
- Inductions (those transient thirty-second verbs that sawn Restlessness, Vitality, Dread, etc) no longer spawn new inductions in their turn.
- Spawn chance of inductions slightly reduced.
- Attempting a Heart or Moth ascension, and then turning aside to be with your beloved, will now trigger the correct ending.
- A special case of a secret victory will now trigger correctly. You'll know it if you've seen it.

- Guises in Dancer now give a small advantage on the relevant expedition

- Passion and Reason textbooks now work with the Lessons Learnt system

v2018.10.h.1: 'Hope'
- When a detective defeats an independent troublemaker, a new troublemaker will appear. The struggle is real.
- Detectives will have more temptations to resist if they burn the first file.
- When Disciples or Exalted followers rebel, they become more powerful Rivals/Long in the making immediately.
- Dammit Fraser stay in the credits

- Laidlaw romance not intermittently in second person
- Cheevos now trigger correctly for exalts, and also won't try to trigger more than once per card
- Elridge doesn't lose his lust: power when promoted to an Assassin
- Jealousy only triggers when romantic interest exists


v2018.10.g.1: 'Gravitas'
- Fleeting Memories can be used again to address Fascination (not sure when that broke)

- round-up of bug fixes and typos/contumps

v2018.10.f.1: 'Ferocity'
- filled in some missing art
- fixed soft-greedy-grab bug that sometimes made the player accidentally bin off their ain true love

- some Dancer fixes and clues
- a small surprise

v2018.10.e.1: 'Elegance'

- A small surprise.


v2018.10.b.1: 'Bitterness'
- Much richer Rivals implementation. Rivals will conduct expeditions and attempt to ascend in your place. Set traps for them and whittle down their health. Treat them with caution, and hope they'll come back around to your side. Or feed Notoriety to the Suppression Bureau in the hope they'll pursue your Rivals instead.
- a larger number of highly specialised victories, and a new loss
- fixed bug where cult formation wasn't giving HQs

v2018.10.a.1: 'Ardour'

- fixed a bug where a save created on the main branch couldn't be saved after loading it on the beta branch


v2018.9.f.1
- Output cards stack more helpfully
- Weary Detective is always the first Hunter spawn
- If you send a mortal follower to destroy evidence, and they fail, they will be wounded rather than disappearing. Summoned minions will still just disappear.

v2018.9.e.1

- Restlessness now also has Heart value. What does not cease, is not ceased.
- Aspirant is now a little more generous with your starting payment
- Aspirant Study verb now unlocks correctly, again
- Two distinct restart bugs fixed. Restart should now behave better.
- lots of WIP for romance and Dancer that shouldn't be visible, but may cause accidental bugs or save issues: let me know if so

v2018.9.d.3
- A very limited preview version of the Dancer legacy (one victory, no ascensions, some other features missing) is available to everyone. Honestly I just wanted to get this patch live and didn't want to fiddle around with DLC. It'll be limited to Perpetual Edition owners / new DLC purchasers next time.
- The Season of Sickness will now also accept Fatigued Health, making Sickness a bit less menacing
- Fatigue now has Heart value, and Restlessness now also has Moth value (I don't really know why it ever didn't)
- Glimmering, Vitality and Erudition spawn more frequently.
- Cult Business and Expedition challenges can no longer have a 100% chance of success - max is 90%. Don't panic! See Wounds notes from 2018.7.d.1

v2018.9.c.2
- A Sanskrit tutor is available.
- Vitality, Erudition and Glimmering are now Influences, and may be sometimes be gained through Augury.

v2018.7.g.1
- abating visions now gives Lantern Influence, not Fleeting Memory

v2018.7.f.1
- fixes for issues with saving and loading. Hit us up at support@weatherfactory.biz if you come across any more save/load issues!
- fixes for double-click assign issues.
- double-click animation is now much faster.
- fixed an issue where the game would forget where a stack started
- double-clicking now opens-closes info panel, so you don't have to wait another half-second on single-click
- Augury cult business displays text on failure again
- vsync enabled on Basic graphics level again - this may help address issues with Mac notebooks inexplicably overheating
- [earlier hotfix] Founding Cults with Health is no longer an endless pit of consuming pain with a game-breaking bug

v2018.7.e.1
- Fleeting Memory cures Fascination! \o/
- Early Night will occasionally create Fascination or Dread :(
- Health, Reason and Passion still count as Ingredients, but using them with Rites or when recruiting/upgrading will convert them to their fatigued versions, instead of using them up.
- Injury still counts as an ingredient. Using it with a Rite or recruitment converts it to a Knock-Scar. (which still has placeholder art, don't panic)

v2018.7.d.1
- Followers who become casualties in Expeditions or Cult Business are now Wounded instead of dying outright
- Wounded Followers can still die if you don't heal them sharpish
- Healed Followers gain Scars which can increase some Aspects
- Three Scars of the same type will kill a Follower anyway
- on the upside, their corpse retains the extra aspects
- ALL THIS IS SUBJECT TO BALANCE AND REVISION AND WHATNOT

v2018.7.b.3

v2018.7.b.2
- bug fixes for double-click and save file issues
- preparatory loc work - don't panic if fonts look a bit different

v2018.7.n.2

- imprisoning a follower now correctly causes notoriety.

v2018.6.n.1

v2018.6.m.1

- Restarting should now always just start from the beginning of your current Legacy.
- Weary Detective is not unique, again, this week.
- Lots of message oddities tidied up
- Unfairly teasing recruitment text no longer appears for Patrons

v2018.6.f.1

- Vignette at the top of the screen is a little lighter.
- Autosave triggering when you're dropping a card sometimes borked your save. We *hope* this is now resolved. Let us know.

v2018.6.e.1
- added hints for Fucine
- Restart button now wants you to be really sure

v2018.6.d.1
- Next/Previous text buttons less twitchy
- Spintriae are now (as intended) only Ingredients, not tools. This should be backwards-compatible with save files in all situations, but please let me know if you hit any problems.
- Saving/reloading with a card in a situation doesn't reset that card's decay lifetime, or any acquired aspects like Detective abilities.
- Saving/reloading doesn't make aspects disappear from Situations

- Nasty save bug fixed (game was silently failing to save on exit in some circumstances)
- Fatigued Abilities, and the Ecdysis Club, now become less bleached, not more, as they refresh
- Shuffling around of Edge, Heart, and Secret Histories works
