v2018.11.d.1:
- 30% of the time, failing to use a Favour to save a Follower would leave you under suspicion instead. This should no longer happen.
- Removed Bloodshed, for now.
- Reduced Fleeting Reminiscence duration to make it more Fleeting.

v2018.11.c.1: 
- Corpses when raised will never fight to break control.
- Corpses when raised with a missing Follower aspect due to wounds will have Follower restored.
- Defeating Fascination with Fleeting Memory never creates a Consciousness of Radiance.
- Moth and Heart endings now correctly signal upcoming endingness.
- Permanent card elimination now occurs when a deck's list of standard cards, not current cards, contains a unique card or uniqueness group member card. Excited yet? Okay, this means that if you draw a book from a deck that reshuffles, it's now permanently eliminated from that deck, so you can't get multiple Viennese Conundra-a from Ecdysis.

v2018.11.b.1: 
- Pawns now correctly show up as Troublemakers in Detective legacies.
- Burgeoning and Shattered Risen will endure for twice as long.
- The Bone Flute can now be given to Followers.
- Ctrl + ' also now brings up the console, as an alternative to Ctrl + `. Sorry, Italian keyboard users and others!
- Clarified some hint text.
- Typo fixes


v2018.11.a.1:

- Stability improvements
- infrastructure work to support localisation
- typos

v2018.10.k.6:
- Stacks of unique items are no longer a thing.
- Detectives can now be captured again.
- Typos
- Fixed a backwards compatibility issue with skill upgrading in the pre-Teresa builds.

v2018.10.k.4: 'Kronos'
- Major change to influences; they can now be harvested and upgraded in a whole bunch of combinations, and they decay slowly. This is an intended change that didn't quite make it into Teresa's Update. [Note: it makes Heart ascension significantly easier.]
- Creeping Breath Curse icon now displays correctly
- Curses can now be defeated, although not easily.
- Tweaks and bumps to Mansus rewards - in particular, there are now a couple of extra ways to get Heart influence.
- Romance: Uses of Strength no longer lets you put any old rubbish in the slot
- Now that Lantern and Winter influence turn into Fascination and Dread, Fascination and Dread no longer give Lantern and Winter influence when defeated.
- Inductions (those transient thirty-second verbs that sawn Restlessness, Vitality, Dread, etc) no longer spawn new inductions in their turn.
- Spawn chance of inductions slightly reduced.
- Attempting a Heart or Moth ascension, and then turning aside to be with your beloved, will now trigger the correct ending.
- A special case of a secret victory will now trigger correctly. You'll know it if you've seen it.
- Fixed a bug where it was possible to skip a step on the route to that secret victory.
- Final Dancer job upgrade now requires Grace specialisation for Health skill.
- Fixed missing text for the final Dancer job upgrade.
- Added an additional Dancer hint.
- Added a side-effect from use of Glassfinger Toxin.


v2018.10.i.1: 'Janus'
- Visions and Despair now give a visible and audible warning when they reach 2 F or D
- Guises in Dancer now give a small advantage on the relevant expedition
- Guises are mutually unique
- Passion and Reason textbooks now work with the Lessons Learnt system

v2018.10.h.1: 'Hope'
- When a detective defeats an independent troublemaker, a new troublemaker will appear. The struggle is real.
- Detectives will have more temptations to resist if they burn the first file.
- When Disciples or Exalted followers rebel, they become more powerful Rivals/Long in the making immediately.
- Dammit Fraser stay in the credits
- Tristan ending image shows up
- Laidlaw romance not intermittently in second person
- Cheevos now trigger correctly for exalts, and also won't try to trigger more than once per card
- Elridge doesn't lose his lust: power when promoted to an Assassin
- Jealousy only triggers when romantic interest exists


v2018.10.g.1: 'Gravitas'
- Fleeting Memories can be used again to address Fascination (not sure when that broke)
- Defeating Fascination gives Lantern influence, defeating Despair gives Winter influence
- round-up of bug fixes and typos/contumps
- The tiniest of surprises

v2018.10.f.1: 'Ferocity'
- filled in some missing art
- fixed soft-greedy-grab bug that sometimes made the player accidentally bin off their ain true love
- some things are unique-r (eg: it should never be possible to have concurrent different versions of the same follower)
- some Dancer fixes and clues
- a small surprise

v2018.10.e.1: 'Elegance'
- bug fixes to Skills/stats
- Corpses and Risen now retain additional aspects from life; so e.g. Winter-scarred corpses are easier to raise and more powerful
- Risen can now be renewed to keep them active longer
- nother book
- a surprise

v2018.10.d.1: 'Detection'
- Nasty ascension bug fixed
- Skills rework: Passion, Reason and Health are now all capped
- ...but much easier to get, with the 'Lesson Learnt' mechanic.
- A small surprise.


v2018.10.b.1: 'Bitterness'
- Much richer Rivals implementation. Rivals will conduct expeditions and attempt to ascend in your place. Set traps for them and whittle down their health. Treat them with caution, and hope they'll come back around to your side. Or feed Notoriety to the Suppression Bureau in the hope they'll pursue your Rivals instead.
- a larger number of highly specialised victories, and a new loss
- fixed bug where cult formation wasn't giving HQs

v2018.10.a.1: 'Ardour'
- Followers are now romanceable (not all followers in all circumstances)
- Extremely minimal Rivals implementation
- various smol fixes and content tweaks
