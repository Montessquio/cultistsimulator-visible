thank you!

- Lottie and Alexis

v2018.5.u.1 changes:


- Lore fragments can now be split into smaller lore fragments - which might help you find the precise lore you need, for riddles or subversion.
- Autosave icon, rather than the intrusive toast (temp icon, will change!)
- Push-scroll (mouse at edge of screen moves viewport) now only operates when you're dragging a card. Thanks for all the feedback on this, folks.
- Creeping Breath Curse now ends after wreaking havoc.
- Hotkey for Collect All / Accept

v2018.5.t.2 changes:

- dropping a card on a token no longer moves the token. This means fewer cascade cardalanches
- cards are a bit more forgiving about being overlapped.

v2018.5.t.1 changes:

- Doom predictor now predicts doom less haphazardly
- St Nympha, not St Respicus (sic), now has the starring role in 'The Rose of Hypatia'
- Lore can no longer be placed directly in the Work verb (there are no recipes it triggers there any more)
- Tweaked some Mansus rewards
- The drawing pin has been replaced by a lovely paperclip
- The screen now scrolls with mouse movement at its edge
- Added more hints'n'clues
- Hotkeys for zooming if you don't have a mousewheel [1,2,3 and Q/E]
- Hotkey for [S]tart
- Lots of audio evolutions and changes



v2018.5.s.3 changes:

- Restarting the game with GOG Galaxy running should no longer asplode
- Clicking an empty slot causes any cards that might fit in it to glow softly, as if thinking about cupcakes
- Settings now accessible from menu screen
- Generic Disciples become Troublemakers in the Detective legacy
- Debug console now appears on CTRL+`, not `. Debug console is NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED and is not to be relied upon
- VFX/SFX now alert you to a new slot appearing in an ongoing situation. Sometimes this will be redundant, so we'll turn it off: let us know where it's spammy
- Cards are now mipmapped, which Martin tells us will reduce a ghastly flickering effect but the word does make me giggle
- Magnet slots will no longer allow cards to be dropped into them manually. This should stop people rampantly abusing The End Is Beautiful to eat detectives
- We put a 'scroll on mouse at edge of screen' feature in but the table did rather tend to drift off into the night, so we've turned it off for now
- We have a couple of dozen achievements on both Steam and GOG, but with luck I've remembered to turn them off in this build
- Perpetual Edition now says 'Perpetual Edition'
- missing titles in Expeditions no longer missing
- Handsomer Options panel

v2018.5.r.1 changes:

- Text in card inspection windows now has room to breathe
- Those with large monitors or accessibility requirements can now resize HUD elements in options
- There's now a visual and audio alert when a slot wants an element. This happens a bit too often on, eg, Despair - we're looking at that.
- Recruit Troublemaker recipe no longer eclipsed by summonings
- Injuries no longer contribute to Despair.
- Fast Forward is a little faster
