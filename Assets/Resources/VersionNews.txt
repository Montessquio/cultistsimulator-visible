v2018.5.s.5 changes:

- Doom predictor now predicts doom less haphazardly
- St Nympha, not St Respicus (sic), now has the starring role in 'The Rose of Hypatia'
- Lore can no longer be placed directly in the Work verb (there are no recipes it triggers there any more)


v2018.5.s.3 changes:

- Restarting the game with GOG Galaxy running should no longer asplode
- Clicking an empty slot causes any cards that might fit in it to glow softly, as if thinking about cupcakes
- Settings now accessible from menu screen
- Generic Disciples become Troublemakers in the Detective legacy
- Debug console now appears on CTRL+`, not `. Debug console is NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED and is not to be relied upon
- VFX/SFX now alert you to a new slot appearing in an ongoing situation. Sometimes this will be redundant, so we'll turn it off: let us know where it's spammy
- Cards are now mipmapped, which Martin tells us will reduce a ghastly flickering effect but the word does make me giggle
- Magnet slots will no longer allow cards to be dropped into them manually. This should stop people rampantly abusing The End Is Beautiful to eat detectives
- We put a 'scroll on mouse at edge of screen' feature in but the table did rather tend to drift off into the night, so we've turned it off for now
- We have a couple of dozen achievements on both Steam and GOG, but with luck I've remembered to turn them off in this build
- Perpetual Edition now says 'Perpetual Edition'
- missing titles in Expeditions no longer missing
- Handsomer Options panel

v2018.5.r.1 changes:

- Text in card inspection windows now has room to breathe
- Those with large monitors or accessibility requirements can now resize HUD elements in options
- There's now a visual and audio alert when a slot wants an element. This happens a bit too often on, eg, Despair - we're looking at that.
- Recruit Troublemaker recipe no longer eclipsed by summonings
- Injuries no longer contribute to Despair.
- Fast Forward is a little faster
