v2020.6.a.1
EXILE

BALANCING

BUG FIXES
- The Night opportunity now has the Deception aspect.
- A crucial missing link made it impossible to get one of the more obscure endings. I've fixed that.
- Profane Weapon purchase opportunity shouldn't have been unique, and it's not now.
- Missing art references fixed for Lionsmith shrine Venice, Colonel shrine Valletta, Book of Suns page purchase ops from zones 2 and 3, Momentum,
- I can confirm that where you were referred to as '[your mother's] son' that was a typo, or rather braino. The gender of Exile characters is unspecified as usual, and this isn't a weird subtle lore point.


v2020.5.z.1
EXILE
- You can now bribe reckoners to pretend they haven't found you, though this gets expensive fast.
- Nasty issue at the Map's Edge where the Foe would sometimes attack you without being present is now fixed.
- Fixed missing art. If you see any more pink question marks, let us know
- The credits were pulling data from the wrong file! and a lot of changes weren't showing up. Fixed.


v2020.5.x.1
MAIN GAME
- Greedy ('magnet') slots can now grab cards while you're dragging them. This was always intended behaviour, but we let the exploit ride until now.
- If you like the old behaviour, set the BIRD/WORM slider to ANARCHY. (you outlaw.)

EXILE DLC
- Packing is quicker.
- There were some grumbles about losing the Wilderness default at map-edge cities, and on reflection, I reckon they're right. I've reverted.
- Underbosses now only appear when there are at least three Traces on tbe board, and the Foe usually arrives only when there are five.
- Underbosses now take four Wounds to kill, though.
- Added some surprises.

v2020.5.q.1
EXILE DLC:
- Using Steel and Science will no longer double-wound.
- Foe's Trophy is now a Proof, not an Opportunity, and will no longer disappear if you change cities. Sorry about that.
- The Foe now does *two* wounds on a hit, sometimes breaks weapons used in defence, and attacks at unpredictable intervals. Sorry about that, too. (This incidentally makes Weaknesses more meaningful.)
- Lots of new art!

v2020.5.d.1
EXILE DLC:
- Portable Assets are now taken with you by default when you travel - but they still take time to pack. You can leave them behind with Relinquish if you're in a hurry.
- removed the option to cancel travel, because no-one was really using it.
- It's now possible, though not necessarily sensible, to speak to all but one Ligeian
- You can use Official Connections to create Opportunities.
- You can now Relinquish your Connections, which might make friends of their enemies, or not.
- Lots of new art

v2020.5.c.1
EXILE DLC:
- Some call it the Halloween Bug, some call it the Terminator Bug. I promise it's now fixed and the Foe really won't come back if you kill him.
- Reworked the Foe loop messages so there's much more clarity about what's going on
- A few more draws (including, significantly, Obscurity) available at the Map's Edge
- The Defiance reset when the Foe gets defeated was intentional, but it's confusing the hell out of everyone so we don't do it anymore.

v2020.5.b.2
EXILE DLC:
- Placeholder text, including ending text, is now populated. *Please don't spoil them for people who aren't in the beta.*
- Connections now revert to their Opportunity state when used up, instead of disappearing
- You can now use certain Connections to defend against Operative and Underboss sabotage
- There's now a use for Pentiments.
- Lots and lots of new art.
- 'I will take you to her.'

v2020.5.a.1
MAIN GAME
- Fixed layout issue for fatigued elements in status bar

EXILE DLC:
- Aspects from new stacks now counted correctly in the status bar (i.e. Stolen Decades->Stolen Years count now correctly reflected)
- Can't fob the Foe off with a profane weapon
- previously packed Cash will now stack with other Cash
- Moth-aspected opportunities no longer do a weird thing they shouldn't 
- Foe no longer gets stuck in a loop if you feed him Obscurity
- "Even before Echidna corrupted the labhite, Chaima would have killed him in the Colonel's name. Now he's not only a monster, but a corrupt monster..."

v2020.4.m.2
EXILE DLC:
- hotfix for some silliness
- Invisible Serapeum content
- and I wanted to get in loads of art that Lottie just drew.

v2020.4.m.1
EXILE DLC:

- Reckoners now move more quickly. Watch out. *The game is currently intended to be a bit too hard to be fun, while I balance.* [If you're finding it too easy - especially on the first one or two playthroughs - let me know, because I may need to squeeze it.]
- However, reckoners can't level up until they have a minimum number of Traces [one for an Operative/Assassin, two for an Underboss, three for the Foe.]
- The Foe now appears in a separate verb, which fixes a bunch of issues and generally makes more sense.
- Map now provides more useful info.
- Allies can learn from experience! When they've been Fatigued three times, an Ally can gain a point of their Aspect. [I'm hoping the time pressure of reckoner pursuit will discourage people from feeling obliged to farm Ally xp by, e.g., repeatedly failing Capers. If that doesn't work, I'll find other ways to limit it. Please let us know your feely feedback.]
- Allies can be sent to another city as a diversionary tactic. There are advantages and disadvantages to this. (They'll gain experience from this, too.)
- Careful: Weapons now don't travel to the next city with you unless packed.
- The first couple of minutes of the game are a bit meatier.
- I'm experimenting with adding Forge, Grail and Knock aspects to Cash.
- I'm experimenting with adding a Moth aspect to Obscurity.
- And I'm experimenting with adding Winter and Grail aspects to corpses.
- You can now leave Cluj-Napoca again.
- More new art!
- Additional Vaults
- Specialist lore now upgrades correctly with reckoner corpses.
- Profane weapons are fairly easy to come by, but you don't start with one.
- You can't summon the Foe to Wilderness.
- 'When all candles be out, all cats be grey.'


v2020.4.k.1
EXILE DLC:

- Medical and Import licences are now Documents (meaning they can fit in Use, again)
- You can't get two Chateau Tarrascons any more.
- Associates will stop defending you if they're dead.
- Exhausted Lore no longer counts as Lore (once again)
- Ruler connections are more expensive, again.
- Rage prevents you fleeing the city for the Wilderness.
- Clarified that Percussigant Pelt stays with you.
- All Opportunities can now be renewed.

EXILE DLC:
- You'll notice a different look to the desktop. This'll be more interactive soon; we're just trying out the look of it.
- Operations now live, including Cults and Uprisings, although nearly all the text is placeholder. This is the last major missing mechanic.
- Consequently, the dial on Obscurity and Trace management difficulty is now turned way up.
- Obscurity must be created - it doesn't arise over time. There are several ways to gain it.
- Traces no longer decay over time. They must be removed, by changing city, or with Deception assets.
- Cash is in much shorter supply.
- You now need two Deception assets to destroy a Trace. (On the upside, you'll convert it to an Obscurity.)

- Medical licenses are no longer available in every city.
- Tranquillity now locks out use of Edge shrines
- The Foe always comes alone to the edge of the map
- It's difficult to be friends with both Rulers and Radicals
- all Troubled areas now have Radicals, and vice versa
- You can now enjoy anything with Comfort, creating contentment. [Supplies will be used up.]
- Dread, Fascination and other familiar elements *are* intentionally in the game. It's not a bug. :) They'll become even more relevant soon.
- It should no longer be possible to kill one reckoner with a wound you caused on a different reckoner.
- The Book of Suns can be reassembled.

v2020.4.g.1
EXILE DLC:
- Added purchase opportunities for curios in most cities.
- You can now see which cities have a Lionsmith or Colonel cult before you go there.
- You can reserve Distraction/Aspect opportunities to use them later.
- It's possible to obtain medical licenses again.
- Every Colonel and Lionsmith shrine is unique.
- Colonel dedications and upgrades give Wounds. Lionsmith dedications and upgrades give Rage.
- Exhausting a Lore and then visiting a shrine would reset your lore progression. This should no longer happen.
- all Allies can now be recruited properly. Sorry about that.
- A pilgrimage with a fully upgraded Colonel or Lionsmith lore skill will now reveal an enemy weakness. [If they're all revealed, nothing happens just now.)
- A pilgrimage with a generic fully upgraded skill is worth a Vitality.

v2020.4.f.1
EXILE DLC:

- Ezeem, Crucible and Teresa are now rather more effectively unique.
- Forlorn Blood may now kill you.


v2018.12.b.1

- Major Expeditions rework to reduce midgame grind, including six new Expeditions. Expeditions now give fixed, more thematically suitable, and usually more impressive, rewards. Default expeditions give you a chance to scoop up books from any Expeditions consumed by Rivals, and also can be repeated to gain Ingredients. (If you're in mid-game when this patch hits, it might mean you get some items twice on your current playthrough: call it a bonus.)
- Fixed a rare issue where it was still sometimes possible to put a stack of >1 card in a slot (if you swapped out one card of that type for a stack of identical cards)
- Fixed an even rarer issue where saving the game with two funds in unstarted Expedition slots would leave you with only 1 Funds on reloading.
- 30% of the time, failing to use a Favour to save a Follower would leave you under suspicion instead. This should no longer happen.

- Rite of the Sea's Marriage is now Rite of the Crow's Quenching.
- You shouldn't see two Detective legacies
- Loads of enhancements to debug console
- Extremely alpha implementation of the first Major Victory. Currently, it's only possible to pursue a Forge apostle legacy (by completing the Forge/Power minor victory) and there is only a very limited implementation
of just one of the immortal enemies you'll face. But it should give you an idea of what's coming. :) [This is unavailable in the main branch.]
- Lessons Learnt now decay to their antecedents. (Thanks for the feedback on this! It should always have been thus, really)

v2018.11.c.1:

- Pawns now correctly show up as Troublemakers in Detective legacies.

- Curses can now be defeated, although not easily.
- Tweaks and bumps to Mansus rewards - in particular, there are now a couple of extra ways to get Heart influence.
- Romance: Uses of Strength no longer lets you put any old rubbish in the slot

- Spawn chance of inductions slightly reduced.
- Attempting a Heart or Moth ascension, and then turning aside to be with your beloved, will now trigger the correct ending.

- round-up of bug fixes and typos/contumps

v2018.10.b.1: 'Bitterness'
- Much richer Rivals implementation. Rivals will conduct expeditions and attempt to ascend in your place. Set traps for them and whittle down their health. Treat them with caution, and hope they'll come back around to your side. Or feed Notoriety to the Suppression Bureau in the hope they'll pursue your Rivals instead.
