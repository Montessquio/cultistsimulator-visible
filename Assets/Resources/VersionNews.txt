v2018.6.h.1
- snap-to-grid for cards is now available; take a look in the Options menu to switch it on.

v2018.6.g.2
- basic data modding is now enabled. See /cultistsimulator_Data/StreamingAssets/content/readme.txt if you're interested.
- more bombproofing on save loading and Mansus exits for fewer crashes.

v2018.6.f.1
- Status bar now shows count of exhausted Abilities
- Detective can now Dream without reading the Sealed File. Thematically I loved that he couldn't Dream until then, but it's too much of a pain for healing from illness.
- Vignette at the top of the screen is a little lighter.
- Autosave triggering when you're dropping a card sometimes borked your save. We *hope* this is now resolved. Let us know.

v2018.6.e.1
- added hints for Fucine
- Restart button now wants you to be really sure

v2018.6.d.1
- Next/Previous text buttons less twitchy
- Spintriae are now (as intended) only Ingredients, not tools. This should be backwards-compatible with save files in all situations, but please let me know if you hit any problems.
- Saving/reloading with a card in a situation doesn't reset that card's decay lifetime, or any acquired aspects like Detective abilities.
- Saving/reloading doesn't make aspects disappear from Situations
- and saving/reloading doesn't let ppl keep marked-for-consumption elements, like funds in bookshops.

v2018.6.c.7

- Sundry crash-proofing effects
- Options Menu should appear reliably
- Options Menu should no longer unpause the game when closed.

v2018.6.b.2

- Dragging Scholarship skill to Work no longer crashes on OSX
- Subverting Winter lore to Heart now consumes Winter
- Cater and Hero can no longer be started with zero funds and end leaving Treacherous Ground in play
- Unnumbered Stones have an ending message.

v2018.6.b.1

- Audio and music no longer default to 10% volume.
- Logo visible on Linux
- Some crash-on-startup issues fixed 
- Added someone to the credits page who was incognito as House Skintwister.


v2018.6.a.5

- Fixed a crash on OSX. Sorry about that, folks.
- Typos!

v2018.5.x.1 changes. This represents a flurry of unusually keen feedback and bug reports: thank you all.

- Ridiculous bug with the S hotkey fixed.
- Moderately ridiculous bug with fatigued ability art fixed.
- Some last touches of the art paintbrush.
- Typo fixes
- ...and an Easter egg of sorts.


v2018.5.w.2 changes. This represents a flurry of unusually keen feedback and bug reports: thank you all.

- Nasty save bug fixed (game was silently failing to save on exit in some circumstances)
- Fatigued Abilities, and the Ecdysis Club, now become less bleached, not more, as they refresh
- Shuffling around of Edge, Heart, and Secret Histories works
- It's no longer possible to incorporate corpses directly into paintings
- Corpses decay to Notoriety. Well they decay to a number of things, but Notoriety is the relevant one.]
- Various typo fixes and clue improvements
- Naming field now accepts a greater variety of characters

v2018.5.u.2 changes:

- More burn images for dramatic moments
- Lore fragments can now be split into smaller lore fragments - which might help you find the precise lore you need, for riddles or subversion.
- Autosave icon, rather than the intrusive toast (temp icon, will change!)
- Push-scroll (mouse at edge of screen moves viewport) now only operates when you're dragging a card. Thanks for all the feedback on this, folks.
- Creeping Breath Curse now ends after wreaking havoc.
- Hotkey for Collect All / Accept
- Unique lantern painting should now display correct text, remove pigment
- The game should no longer misbehave if autosave occurs while you're dragging something.

v2018.5.t.2 changes:

- dropping a card on a token no longer moves the token. This means fewer cascade cardalanches
- cards are a bit more forgiving about being overlapped.

v2018.5.t.1 changes:

- Doom predictor now predicts doom less haphazardly
- St Nympha, not St Respicus (sic), now has the starring role in 'The Rose of Hypatia'
- Lore can no longer be placed directly in the Work verb (there are no recipes it triggers there any more)
- Tweaked some Mansus rewards
- The drawing pin has been replaced by a lovely paperclip
- The screen now scrolls with mouse movement at its edge
- Added more hints'n'clues
- Hotkeys for zooming if you don't have a mousewheel [1,2,3 and Q/E]
