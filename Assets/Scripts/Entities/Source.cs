//but then identity comparisons failed in unit tests so I stored static objects
//If I need to identify sources as more than SourceTypes, this may cause issues later
///I'm.... not sure if I need those actual method wrappers. But I like the syntax.

// What's all this, Alexis?
// I'm glad you asked, Alexis. The convenience method above returns a reference to these static instances
// And while the instances can not be changed (since readonly), their property "SourceType" could. So to
// avoid that, the SourceType can now only be set privately to avoid anyone changing it.
// Instead of changing sourcetype, just get a new Source reference directly.
