	"description": "Sorry everyone! This broke more than I realised. Most urgent fixes are in, I'm working on the rest.\n
- Game no longer crashes when scouting a city in Exile immediately after travelling to that city\n
- Fixed Chinese & Japanese loc\n
- Leaving at Mansus, then reloading, no longer crashes game\n
- Slowed down token travel time for greedy slots and click-to-send, rapid speed was alarming erryone\n
- Camera feels smoother (I haven't added the old drift effect back - but I might yet)\n
- Force-set gridsnap to 1/4. This will address a lot of perceived card placement probs. You can change it back tho.",

- Purging elements once again transforms them to decayed form, if they have one\n - changed anti-aliasing settings; should make text more readable but let me know your experiences\n - more than 4 deck effects in a recipe now possible, you LUNATICS
- Consuming slots now have the same effect as purge: i.e., if the card in that slot decays to a final form, it'll do that instead of disappearing.
- Ending flavours work again
- Better font support for Central and Eastern European languages (see MODDING_README.txt)
- Elements in a verb are clickable again
- Expulsions no longer break game
- Dropping token on an occupied slot sends the incumbent away, not both
- Hilarious stack-splitting bug fixed
 - Locs for mods should work again ",
