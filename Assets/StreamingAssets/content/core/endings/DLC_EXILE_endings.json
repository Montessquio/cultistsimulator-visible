description: "<i>...and so I did it. I got them off my trail. I haven't seen a reckoner since. But I couldn't risk them picking up the trail again. So I kept moving... until I wound up here, on the other side of the world. It's not a bad place. But I miss Paris. And I'm getting bored. I know that's dangerous. So I'm looking for funding for an expedition. Going south. See if it's true what we heard from Grytviken, about that thing inland, and what it's doing to the snow.'</i>

description: "<i>'Money isn't everything. But I've been poor, I've been rich, and I've learnt that I'd rather be rich. And rich I am, enough to have bought protection against even my Foe if he ever finds me under my new name. Adepts need to eat like anyone else. It won't last. One thing I learnt from my reckoner days: no matter how many years you have, they run out in the end. And just now, no-one's shooting at me, and I have a ballroom to put my Christmas tree in. If that's not a happy ending, I don't know what is.'</i>

description: "<i>'...finally, I'm delighted to report that the Continental reckoner war has resolved itself. Defau, who you'll recall from the Ortucchio incident, seems to have fallen out with his protégé, and the business ended as you'd expect, given it's Defau we're talking about. The local authorities have turned over the protégé's remains to us, but there's not much left - I don't think it really qualifies as a cadaver, so much as a souvenir. But I'll have it sent up to Zurich for you. Call it a Christmas present.'</i>
