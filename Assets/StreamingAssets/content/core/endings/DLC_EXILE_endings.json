description: "<i>...and so I did it. I got them off my trail. I haven't seen a reckoner since. But I couldn't risk them picking up the trail again. So I kept moving... until I wound up here, on the other side of the world. It's not a bad place. But I miss Paris. And I'm getting bored. I know that's dangerous. So I'm looking for funding for an expedition. Going south. See if it's true what we heard from Grytviken, about that thing inland, and what it's doing to the snow.'</i>

description: "<i>'Money isn't everything. But I've been poor, I've been rich, and I've learnt that I'd rather be rich. And rich I am, enough to have bought protection against even my Foe if he ever finds me under my new name. Adepts need to eat like anyone else. It won't last. One thing I learnt from my reckoner days: no matter how many years you have, they run out in the end. And just now, no-one's shooting at me, and I have a ballroom to put my Christmas tree in. If that's not a happy ending, I don't know what is.'</i>

But I fought to get free of that. If I really get bored, I could pick a fight with someone else. Or I could go travelling again. There's a lot of the world, and it's not all mapped yet. Or I could sit here and keep the sunset company  a while longer, maybe finish the bottle, maybe not. All I need to do is decide.'</i>

description: "<i>'...finally, I'm delighted to report that the Continental reckoner war has resolved itself. Defau, who you'll recall from the Ortucchio incident, seems to have fallen out with his protégé, and the business ended as you'd expect, given it's Defau we're talking about. The local authorities have turned over the protégé's remains to us, but there's not much left - I don't think it really qualifies as a cadaver, so much as a souvenir. But I'll have it sent up to Zurich for you. Call it a Christmas present.'</i>

description: "<i>'If I'd known how much fun it is being an Edge dyad, I'd have started causing trouble long ago. It hurts sometimes, of course, but that's battle, and the opposite of battle is death. My Foe and I are harbingers of strife. Where we go, war follows, and we're stronger every day. It's glorious. One day, perhaps, I might somehow still kill him, or he'll kill me, and then we'll both be dead. I think about that sometimes. I still hate him, though it's a familiar and warming flame, and that means I'd like him to die, even if I go down too. But if that ever happens, there'll be a lot of blood under the bridge first.'</i>
