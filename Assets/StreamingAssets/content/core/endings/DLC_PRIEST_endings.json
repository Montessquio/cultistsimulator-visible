description: "When I open, I open like the arms of the Mother, and open I will remain, as the shell from which the pearl is taken. The space where I was will be a postern-gate in the fortress of days, that only  my initiates will ever pass. But in the Fifth History alone, my skin will peel from me in tatters. My teeth will be long and my flesh scant upon my bones as sea-wrack, and I will rise like a wave and hood myself to mark what I have become. \n[Congratulations on a standard Threshold victory. You have wrestled the game to its knees. There are other paths.]",
